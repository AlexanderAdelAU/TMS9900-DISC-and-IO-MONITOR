# TMS9900-DISC-and-IO-MONITOR

The Memory Resident Monitor is responsible for providing the core IO and DISC interfaces required to the Single Board Computer.   
For example all the XOP Defintions are defined, such as CALL, PUSH, POP, RET etc as well as all the interfaces reoutines required
to interface to a Western Digital type Floppy Disc Controller if implemented.   

The Monitor is unlikely to be immediately reusable in your current system but some to the routines can be ported as needed.
