# TMS9900-DISC MONITOR

The ROM Memory Resident Monitor is responsible for providing the core IO and DISC interfaces required to the Single Board Computer.   
For example all the XOP Defintions are defined, such as CALL, PUSH, POP, RET etc as well as all the interfaces routines required
to interface to a Western Digital type Floppy Disc Controller (FDC 1797), and a IDE/SATA interface that will support the latest Solid State Drives (SSD) (version 3).   The Disc IO provides a basic BIOS but relies on a CP/M type DOS system to be fully functional.   Note that for versions 4.0 and greater:
	* The Floppy Disc Interfaces have been removed as they are replaced by the IDE, and are therefore redundant.
        * Memory segmentation is supported.  For an example see the TMS_99105A_SBC repository

The Monitor provides the following commands: (Q,O,[space],G,R,W,U)

**Q(Quick Boot)**  This will boot the OS from the disc in drive 0

**U(Upload)**   This command will upload an Intel hex file into the TMS9900 SBC memory space.  This is how the system files are created etc.  Once the **U** command has been issued, go to your terminal and select the Hex file that you want to upload.  The Upload command will sit forever waiting for the **:** colon to begin.  Once received it will then handshake to upload the full file.  For example, here the dots indicate each 16 byte block of data (as per the intel format):

~~~
<TMS9900 DISC MONITOR V2.1>
>U......................................................................................

Once uploaded, the loaded file can be exectued using the **<hex address>G(Go)>** command.

**V (Upload Segment Hex File)**.  This command will allow you to upload a segment hex file.  This is a modified Intel hex file that contains an additional byte that is inserted before the address field to indicate which memory segment to insert the data into.  These files are identified in source through the use of the SEG psuedo op.  For example the following will inster the hex 0x01 into the H99 file just before the address field:
```
	SEG  <0,1> 	; Either 0 or 1
	AORG	500H
```
During upload the segment V command will insert a plus sign in the response to indicate that the file is inserting into the requested memory segment.

**<HexAddress>O(Open)**  Will open or list of 8 rows displaying the memory contents begining at the HexAddress.  Press Space to show the next 8 rows etc.

**<HexAddress>(Space )** Will open the memory location for editing.  Space will continue the editing to the next memory address

**<HexAddress>G(Go)**. Go will execute the memory based programme that is located at the HexAddress.  So, you can use the Upload command to load the Shell, DOS etc and then use the Go command to run the disc initialisation or (DISKINIT) programme.

**<HexAddress>W(Workspace Register)**.  This will enter the hexaddress into the workspace register and define your workspace.  W by itself will print the 
 value of current workspace register.

**<HexAddress>R(Registers)**.  This command will print out the workspace registers located at the hexaddress, or will use the current workspace value.
For example:
~~~
>>4R
     WP=0004
    R0  = DCA2 R1  = A8F9
    R2  = ED20 R3  = F66A
    R4  = ED30 R5  = F638
    R6  = ED40 R7  = F66E
    R8  = E8BD R9  = 26BD
    R10 = C900 R11 = 703B
    R12 = B235 R13 = 783D
    R14 = 1185 R15 = E4E1
~~~

These basic commands are generally all that is required of a basic Monitor as the majority of all the other tasks can be use normal programmes and the Operating System.
